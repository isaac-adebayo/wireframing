## Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

### Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a visual representation of a user interface that outlines the basic structure and layout of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It serves as a blueprint, focusing on content placement, navigation, and functionality without including detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframing is important in the design process because it allows teams to:

- Clarify ideas and requirements early before development begins.

- Identify usability issues and improve user experience.

- Facilitate communication among designers, developers, stakeholders, and clients.

- Save time and resources by reducing costly revisions later in the project.

By laying a solid foundation, wireframes ensure the final product aligns with both user needs and business goals.
